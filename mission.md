# Agent Mission

**Objective:** Build a B2B Sellers List Parser.

## Description
This agent allows you to parse B2B seller data from specified sources. It should:
1.  Navigate to target B2B platforms.
2.  Extract seller information (name, contact details, product categories).
3.  Save the data in a structured format (CSV, JSON, Excel).

## Success Criteria
- The parser can handle dynamic content (if any).
- Data is accurately extracted and saved.
- The process is robust against simple anti-bot measures (headers, delays).
